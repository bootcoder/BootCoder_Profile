				<h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
				<p>As an America white male, I must say that stereotype threats are not something I have a great deal of experience with personally. That is not to say that I have not witnessed it first hand only that I am lucky enough to be in the demographic that feels the bite the least. I feel though that this is very unfair. The thought that some people look upon others and judge them based upon their appearance is very disheartening. No where is this ideology more prevalent than in the south. I do my best to council those around me to look inward when measuring a (wo)man, because you never know what's just under the surface. It is ironic then that I do personally judge the people that behave in such a fashion negatively, if they cannot look beyond the color of someones skin, the lifestyle they choose or the way they fix their hair, then I cannot look past their shortsightedness to see what other qualities may lie beneath.</p>
