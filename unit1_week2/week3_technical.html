			<h2>Array vs. Hash</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>Arrays</h3>
				<p>Think of an array as a bucket you can throw things in. You can put whatever you want in the<br>
					bucket. Strings, numbers, booleans, objects etc... The order you add items is the order they are in unless you change it.</p>
				<p>Arrays are used to contain groups of data,</p>
				<p>Then allow you to work through that data to many useful ends.</p>

				<h3>Hashes</h3>
				<p>Think of Hashes as a being like a phonebook. Each name has a number.<br>
					Similarly, hashes contain groups of information. Each data set consisits of<br>
					two properties. The key and the value. Like age => 32</p>
