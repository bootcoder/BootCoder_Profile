				<h3>Time Management VS: Workforce Moral</h3>
				<p>A big issue that I seem to keep hearing about is how company's deal with time, & the subsequent demands on employees.</p>
				<p>Time issues include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Estimating times before fully knowing the path to completion</li>
					<li>Estimating times without understanding the actual requirements of each step</li>
					<li>Failing to consider all phases of the development process (i.e. We forgot to test!)</li>
					<li>Moving goal posts mid stream</li>
				</ul>
						
				<p>In this fast paced, hustle bustle world, it's easy to understand how working on a project can encounter these issues. Everyone wants things done yesterday and they want them to be perfect the day before that. Unfortunately, this is not the case. You can have your software quick or you can have it correct. I'm told never the twain shall meet. There are however things we can do in our profession to mitigate these demands. Starting with the issues listed above, a huge portion of software stress is derived from over burdensome time requirements for project completion. A proactive approach could be undertaken with managers to really focus on time estimation. Emphasis could be placed on having developer's contribute to project estimates and allocation of initial resources. The last point especially can save drastically down the line as the likelihood of having to add in extra "fresh" developers to meet goal is greatly mitigated.</p>

				<p>Speaking of resource allocation, a big portion of time issues in the industry are the result of over-stated goals with an under-nourished, overworked software team. A happy coder is an effective coder and the greater his performance will be. 
					There are several ways to make for a more efficient software environment through improved moral. Such as:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Avoid unreasonable goals</li>
						<li>Vivid enjoyable atmosphere</li>
						<li>Extended vacation policy</li>
						<li>Reduce multi-tasking demands</li>
						<li>Seek out and implement suggestions</li>
						<li>Reduce "red tape" policies</li>
						<li>New Mac Pro's for everyone</li>
					</ul>
