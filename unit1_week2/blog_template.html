				<h3>Prep, Fireside Chats and The Great Adventure.</h3>
				<p>Just finished watching Shereef's fireside chat. I have to say I was quite impressed. Many questions lurking in the back of my mind were answered. Also the talk had a good helping of overall great advice.</p>
				<p>The section on Kitchen VS: Table really hit home with me. I feel like I've spent a part of my time in the table roll. I recognize the benefits of kitchen and want to make a move fully in that direction. I can't just order up what I want in this life. If I want it, I will have it, by my own design and creation.</p>
				<p>Also I thought the questions posed were quite excellent indeed.</p>
				<p>Including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hours @ DBC</li>
					<li>Placement rates & what that means</li>
					<li>Phase 4</li>
					<li>Arrays & Strum Theory</li>
					<li>Time Boxes & Pomodoro's</li>
					<li>Books & Prep</li>
					<li>Drop Rates...</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I felt like I am on a very familiar wave length listening to the answers to these questions. Many things I've been wondering about were addressed and it seems like my internal best case scenario is pretty much what Shereef and DBC are trying to accomplish. This aligning has brought me a great deal of comfort, as I'm hoping that this will indicate a stronger fit for me in the DBC environment.<br><br></p>

				<p>Another part I really enjoyed was addressing the fears people have before arriving at DBC. I can say that I can really identify with this part of the talk. I am ( I think most of us are) very afraid of being too slow and falling behind. BUT, I know that once I'm there, I can jump in with both feet and the learning dynamic for me will be polar opposite from prep, where I have been juggling A LOT.</p>
