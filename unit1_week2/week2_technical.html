				<h3>Week 2 - Why is JavaScript so awesome for web development.</h3>
				<p>I hardly have the bon-a-fides to comment expertly on the matter. But in so far as I can see</p>
				<p>Javascript main claim to fame is that it is the one truly global web develoment language. Becuase</p>
				<p>it runs on all modern browsers.</p>
				<p>One could easily say that it is the best language by offering the fact that there are more</p>
				<p>Javascript posts on Github and StackOverflow than for any other language.</p>
				<p>This in turn correlates to a very high degree of online resources.</p>
