				<h3>Exercise 1</h3>
				<p>When I think of the best moments looking back I would have to say I felt most like:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Accomplishment</li>
					<li>Achievement</li>
					<li>Adventure</li>
					<li>Coolness under fire</li>
					<li>Cooperation</li>
					<li>Meaningful work</li>
					<li>Persistence</li>
					<li>Quality</li>
					<li>Responsibility</li>
					<li>Trustworthiness</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Exercise 2</h3>
				<p>Coolness under fire.</p>
				<p>I think this is one of the finer traits you can have professionally. Life is full of ups and downs, I have found that it is the truest measure of a (wo)man to see them perform when everything that can go wrong does. Lots of people are trustworthy, responsible, persistent, and so forth. Very few however, can be totally zen when the chips are down and the ride gets bumpy. Because, after all, if it was easy everyone would be doing it.  </p>

				<h3>Exercise 4</h3>
				<p>The last time someone asked me for advice</p>
				<p>My brother called last week, he is finishing up his educators interniship. Apparently the teacher</p>
				<p>he is studying under is not a great joy to spend the days with.. I told him to bide his time,</p>
				<p>do his best and keep his head down. This too shall surly pass, for time is the fuel we all burn.</p>
