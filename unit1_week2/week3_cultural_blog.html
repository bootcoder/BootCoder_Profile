			<h2>Pairing</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</h3>
				<p>I've go to say the pairing is absolutely terrific.</p>
				<p>Seems like at the end of every pairing session people are saying<br>
					thanks so much you really knew what you were doing.<br>
					And I'm thinking....Me if it weren't for you I'd be totally sunk!</p>
					<p>I guess everyone feels that way. So it's great to be able to work together and grow as a unit.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h3>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</h3>
				<p>Pairing in general has been very rewarding thus far.<br>
					I love working with other people and sharing knowledge.<br>
					Also, it's been a big esteem booster to realize that <br>
					I'm not as far behind as I feel staring at the screen alone </p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</h3>
				<p>In regards to pairing... No not really<br>
					If I had to e frustrated by one thing I guess it would be having to<br>
					copy paste out of stypi to run code through the interpreter.</p>

			<h2>Feedback</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>Receiving Feedback</h3>
				<p>I've only received one piece of feedback, from Greg for my GPS 1.1.<br>
					I felt pretty good about it. The feedback was very positive overall.<br>
					The only advise was to clean up a few class definitions which I will certainly heed.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Giving Feedback</h3>
				<p>I enjoy writing feedback for people I have worked with. The hardest part though is<br>
					finding things to critique. It seems like everyone is trying very hard and<br>
					our collective low level technical bonafides appear to be sufficent, at least so far....</p>
