				<h3>What is Rails?</h3>
				<p>Rails is a web development framework for the ruby programming language.<br>Rails relies on the Model-View-Controller design pattern.</p>
				<img src="http://www.jansipke.nl/wp-content/uploads/mvc.png">
				<p class = "break">Model</p>
				<p>The model is the part of your application that is responsible for storing and retrieving objects from a database. This model is the logic behind how your app works, the gears behind the curtain so to speak.</p>

				<p class = "break">View</p>
				<p>The view is the part of the app which controls the content that is actually displayed to the end user. These could be static pages or dynamically generated pages using interactive ruby.</p>

				<p class = "break">Controller</p>
				<p>The controller straddles the void between the Model and the View. Basicly the controller fetches information from the database based on the parameters provided by the model, then it passes said information to the view to be displayed to the end user. </p>
