				<h3>Emotional Conflict</h3>
				<p>We all deal with emotional conflict in our lives, both professionally & privately. How we cope with it, is what stands us apart.</p>
				<p>A recent time in my life when I had to deal with emotional conflict was a disagreement with my father concerning Dev Bootcamp. He can't get over the fact that it's located in S.F. His love affair with Faux News has him convinced that S.F. is the debauchery capitol of the world. Which translated into many stern talks with negative connotations on the matter. It hurts me that he was not able to bring himself to be happy for me and wish me well. I have delt with the unfavorable response by maintaining a positive attitude, reinforcing positive characteristics of DBC and the bay area in general and stayed resolute in my studies in a visible manner. As a result he has accepted the absolution of my decision. After a year of preparation and talk, the time is almost here, and finally my father is coming around. Not quite positive expressions just yet, but unbiased inquisition at the very least. Overall, I would say that's a positive change. If I could had to do it again, I would do the same. Stay resolute and persistent in my endeavors and those who cast doubt will eventually be either drowned out or brought to see the truth of the matter. From this I learned that if my convictions are strong and I believe in myself above all else, I will persevere.</p>
