				<h3>Stereotype Threat and Me</h3>
				<p>Harking back to an earlier blog entry, I identified the following values from successful moments in my life.</p>
				<div class="code_block">				
					<ul>
						<li>Accomplishment</li>
						<li>Achievement</li>
						<li>Adventure</li>
						<li>Coolness under fire</li>
						<li>Cooperation</li>
						<li>Meaningful work</li>
						<li>Persistence</li>
						<li>Quality</li>
						<li>Responsibility</li>
						<li>Trustworthiness</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>If I were to pick one value here that stands above the rest in combating stereotype threat it would have to be cooperation. After all cooperation is the polar opposite of stereotype.</p>
				<p>The others don't particularly lend themselves to combating stereotype threat, but I feel that they are terrific values none the less. Accomplishment, Achievement, Adventure, Coolness, Meaningful work, Persistence, Quality and Responsibility are all feelings I look forward to cultivating further during DBC.</p>
