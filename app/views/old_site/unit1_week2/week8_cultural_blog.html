				<h3>Prep, Fireside Chats and The Great Adventure.</h3>
				<p>Just finished watching<a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's fireside chat</a>. I have to say I was quite impressed. Many questions lurking in the back of my mind were answered. Also the talk had a good helping of overall great advice.</p>
				<p class = "break">Kitchen VS: Table </p>
				<p>This section really hit home with me. I feel like I've spent a part of my time in the table role. I recognize the benefits of kitchen and want to make a move fully in that direction. I can't just order up what I want in this life. If I want it, I will have it, by my own design and creation.</p>
				<p class="break">Question & Awesome Answers</p>
				<p>I thought the questions posed were quite excellent indeed.</p>
				<p>Including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hours @ DBC</li>
					<li>Placement rates & what that means</li>
					<li>Phase 4</li>
					<li>Code Tips & Strum Theory</li>
					<li>Time Boxes & Pomodoro's</li>
					<li>Books & Prep</li>
					<li>Drop Rates...</li>
					<li>Coding Clone Wars</li>
					<li>Pairs, do I have to?? YES!</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I felt like I am on a very familiar wave length listening to the answers to these questions. Many things I've been wondering about were addressed and it seems like my internal best case scenario is pretty much what Shereef and DBC are trying to accomplish. This aligning has brought me a great deal of comfort, as I'm hoping that this will indicate a stronger fit in the DBC environment.<br><br></p>
				
				<p class ="break">Fears</p>
				<p>Another part I really enjoyed was addressing the fears people have before arriving at DBC. I can say that I can really identify with this part of the talk. I am ( I think most of us are) very afraid of being too slow and falling behind. BUT, I know that once I'm on site, I can jump in with both feet and the learning dynamic for me will be polar opposite from prep, where I have been juggling A LOT.</p>
				<p class ="break">Phase 4 thingy...</p>
				<p>Last but not least I'd like to give a HUGE up-vote to the Idea of a Phase 4 for JS. But only if I could roll right into it with no break. I'll start the job search after. Several DBC grads I have spoken with have said to me how hard and super tough the program is, but also how much they learned in such a short time period. If I could take that same concept and rocket my JS knowledge before finishing. I would. The feeling is that JS is a very important language to really have a strong foundation in. I have polled several developers at local meetup's and JavaScript has come up in every conversation. So... yeah, totally down with that! </p>
