				<h3><a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a></h3>
				<p>This is one of my favorite sites because I'm a gadget junkie. Turns out, this is the place for me.</p>
				<p>When I first look at the site, I am drawn immediately to the article content area. Which is a good thing considering that would be the most important part of the site. I would say that this site is well organized, with a very clean look, styling that is effective but not over the top. The content is spot on for their target audience. Content is arranged by chronological submission. So it is very easy to locate, say an article you read there yesterday.</p>

				<h3><a href="http://www.drudge.com">Drudge: Red Meat for Yellow Dogs</a></h3>
				<p>This site Drudge.com is the left-wing news outlet copied in name and style from the infamous right wing site <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com">Drudge Report</a>. It is my number one place for news. I check it every day, browsing the stories and tabbing open ones that I find intriguing. The design is terrific. Stories are laid out in chronological submission order along three columns. The eye is drawn directly to the story content section, mostly due to the fact that this section takes up the vast majority of screen real estate. I do not get bored with it. The site serves it's purpose exactly as long as is required and then I shut it down. Access to the contents of the site is very easy. Finding what you need only requires that you open your eyes.</p>

				<h3><a href="http://www.vixenvapors.com">Vixen Vapors</a></h3>
				<p>Vixen is an E-juice supply store on-line. They have terrific deals every day. The site is pretty well put together. Nav column on the left and cart column on the right. Content is displayed down the middle with a search bar located up top. Visually I would say the site is very easy to look at as well as to navigate. Functionally however, the site is lacking. Multiple products have the same reviews, indicating that reviews are not genuine but rather disseminated from a central source. Again, boredom is not an issue at this site as my typical visit entails browsing the products I know I want, checking out and hitting the (interweb)road.</p>
